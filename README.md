# Sole Trader Identification Frontend

This is a Scala/Play frontend to allow Sole Traders to provide their information to HMRC.

### How to run the service

2. Stop the frontend in service manager using `sm --stop SOLE_TRADER_IDENTIFICATION_FRONTEND`
3. Run the frontend locally using
`sbt 'run 9717 -Dapplication.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes'`

### End-Points
